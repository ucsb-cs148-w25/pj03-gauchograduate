Team Roles and Github Contributions
We ask every team to comment on the code contributions that every team member made. You already documented leadership roles within the team management (in team/LEADERSHIP.md), and now we ask you to document the roles the team members played in the code development effort. You can comment on team contributions other than coding as well. In your github team folder, please create a contributions subfolder.

This lab just requires you to start the document in team/contributions/CONTRIBS.md, but you have until the final materials submissions deadline to update and edit it:
Document and write commentary on team member code (and/or other) contributions in team/contributions/CONTRIBS.md: each team member should initially write their own section.

Suggestion: each team member should initially create a draft of their part in team/contributions/contrib_Alice.md, team/contributions/contrib_Bob.md, team/contributions/contrib_Carol.md, team/contributions/contrib_Danny.md…
Then: the person asseembling the overall CONTRIBS.md report can copy/paste those separate files into one unified CONTRIBS.md file.
Today: Review and discuss the /graphs/contributors report for your project repo.
You can find it by clicking “insights” then “contributors” on Github.
Is the Contributors graph accurate?
Note that there can be disparities between the contributors graph and ground truth code contributions by teeam members. Some groups may have chosen to follow a pair programming approach, and consistently only one member may have done the commits. Or a team member may have used different github accounts when interacting with the code base. Whatever the situation, it is too late to fix the commits, but it’s NOT too late to offer an explanation in your team/contributions/CONTRIBS.md commentary.

We are going to look at the data on the /graphs/contributors for your repo, but
We are going to look more at your explanation of that data.
If the data and the explanation match, it’s all good.

If you have a team member that you know or suspect has made lots of commits that are not being attributed to them, scroll through your commit log and see if you can find a few examples.

If the commits look ok, but don’t tell the full story (e.g. a team member may have just contributed very few, but very important commits), you can bring that out in your commentary, too.

Even distribution of the coding effort among all team members is definitely not expected, but highly uneven contributions, especially when paired with potential team dissatisfaction expressed through the catme.org surveys is grounds for individual weighting of the project grade component among team members.
