## Vala's Contributions
I built out the API functionality of the app, allowing for team members who were working on the frontend to communicate with the backend. I also set up the database schema for the app and configured our database provider, Supabase. I worked with other team members on the ideal storage format for the data, such as how we would represent a user's schedule and how we would represent a course requirement override. Beyond this, I worked on optimizing the frontend code, such as adding caching where possible to make the app load much faster, adding loading screens to make the app more responsive, and adding various frontend features like the "Saving" indicator, all contributing to responsive design. I also worked on resolving any bugs that popped up, such as bugs with the override implementation.
