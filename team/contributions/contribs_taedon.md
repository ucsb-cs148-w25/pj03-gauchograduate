The process of working with a sizeable team to bring a program to life through industry standards was completely new to me, so I mainly pair programmed with Jaren this entire quarter. Together, we were assigned 
a few overarching issues such as setting up authorization, saving students' schedules across logins, and updating the database to mimic what occurred on the front end. 
We mainly utilized API endpoints Vala set up to coordinate actions on the front end with data in the back end. In our pair programming sessions, Jaren and I worked on each task together; we would first
focus on handling the logic for validating user authentication then work on ensuring that schedule data persisted correctly in the database. We regularly physically coding to make sure we both 
understood each part of the process and to maintain consistent progress. Beyond coding, I contributed to debugging sessions where we encountered mismatches between the frontend display and the 
backend data. This often required us to trace API calls and examine JSON payloads to find where updates were failing. Although I did not make as many direct commits as other team members like Vala or Chiran, 
many of my contributions were through collaborative work and refining shared code. For example, some of the commits under Jaren's name include code we worked on together while pair programming. Additionally, 
I helped lead a lot of the retros and stand ups, making sure we all understood what was due at the end of the week, and team dynamic checks.
