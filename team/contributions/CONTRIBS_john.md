What I worked on:
- Scraping course data
- cleaning course data
- scraping prerequisite data
- cleaning/ converting prerequisite data to json logic format

What the graph shows on github:
- lower commits compared to other team members

Explanation of the graph on github:
- Pair programming: Me and Kade frequently worked on parts of the project together in pair programming.
- Trial and Error, Pivoting in data collection:
  - Instead of contributions shown in code, a lot of my time was spent researching web scraping tools, trial and error in OpenAI api prompting to get it to parse the prereq data correctly, and manually checking for incorrect OpenAI api responses. Additionally, we ran into issues where an initial batch of data from ucsbplat.com was not viable for parsing and then we had to pivot to ucsb GOLD. The unstructured problem of data scraping and cleaning led to less contributions shown on github but nonetheless the effort is shown in the data produced in the end.
