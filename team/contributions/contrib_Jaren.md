The things I contributed / peer programmed with Taedon  was primarily working on Google OAuth integration and establishing the connection between the frontend and backend. 
The contributions to linking the backend and frontend included implementing features that allowed users to select courses, populate their schedules, and input grades for completed courses. 
Additionally, I helped develop functionality for calculating and displaying students' grade point averages based on their entered grades.
Much of this process involved creating new functions to handle fetch and get requests, ensuring that user data was properly updated and retrieved from the database. 
With the retrieved data, I also developed functions to dynamically update the frontend, enabling users to log in and out while preserving their previously entered information.
Other contributions included implementing a redirect feature to guide new users to an update profile page.
