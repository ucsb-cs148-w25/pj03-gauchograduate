## AI Tools Used in this Project

### Vala's AI tools
I used a lot of [Codebuff](https://www.codebuff.com/), a CLI AI tool which automatically ingests your Git project and allows you to make broad prompts to implement new features, refactor, or modify your codebase in anyway.
I also used a lot of ChatGPT anytime I had broader, general questions about the new frameworks I was using. For example, asking questions about how prisma migrations worked, I used ChatGPT.
Usefulness: This tool was extremely useful. I am new to Next.js and React, and this helped shorten the learning curve by a large margin. Anytime I was confused or wanted the skeleton of a file that performed a certain functionality, I just asked codebuff to generate it and it was very easy to fill in the details.
Correctness: While generally the AI responses were pretty accurate, sometimes Codebuff would trip up with generating the correct types and stuff. To ensure I wasn't pushing messed up code, after manually reviewing stuff myself I would run the ESLint linter as well as `npm build` to ensure my code passed the TSX compiler as well as all other build steps. If there were issues, I could reprompt Codebuff and give it the issues. Overall, I would say it has extremely improved my productivity.

### Kade's AI tools
I used some [Codebuff](https://www.codebuff.com/) to learn about it's capabilities. I asked it to setup a basic website with navagational functionality and then further experiemented with it's ability to create different tools (ie. I tried making a turn tracker for a game). Because I'm not super familiar with css and html I am unable to verify if the code it writes is "correct". The only thing I'm able to do is load the webpage and see if it's what I want or copy/paste an error message. Furthermore I've tried using some CoPilot (with the extension in VS Code). I tried using it to convert a neural network written in TensorFlow to a neural network written in PyTorch. This would be usefull if it worked but I was unable to get the code to run successfully. I ran into multiple "loops" where I would get an error, CoPilot would change one line, I would get another error, and CoPilot would change the line right back to what it was originally. This demonstrated a lack of full understanding of the problem where likely the error message wasn't super helpful and CoPilot didn't/couldn't successfully debug it. Thus this ended up not being correct and therefore wasn't very useful.
