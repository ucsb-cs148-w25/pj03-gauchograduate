## AI Tools Used in this Project

### Vala's AI tools
I used a lot of [Codebuff](https://www.codebuff.com/), a CLI AI tool which automatically ingests your Git project and allows you to make broad prompts to implement new features, refactor, or modify your codebase in anyway.
I also used a lot of ChatGPT anytime I had broader, general questions about the new frameworks I was using. For example, asking questions about how prisma migrations worked, I used ChatGPT.
Usefulness: This tool was extremely useful. I am new to Next.js and React, and this helped shorten the learning curve by a large margin. Anytime I was confused or wanted the skeleton of a file that performed a certain functionality, I just asked codebuff to generate it and it was very easy to fill in the details.
Correctness: While generally the AI responses were pretty accurate, sometimes Codebuff would trip up with generating the correct types and stuff. To ensure I wasn't pushing messed up code, after manually reviewing stuff myself I would run the ESLint linter as well as `npm build` to ensure my code passed the TSX compiler as well as all other build steps. If there were issues, I could reprompt Codebuff and give it the issues. Overall, I would say it has extremely improved my productivity.

### Kade's AI tools
I used some [Codebuff](https://www.codebuff.com/) to learn about it's capabilities. I asked it to setup a basic website with navagational functionality and then further experiemented with it's ability to create different tools (ie. I tried making a turn tracker for a game). Because I'm not super familiar with css and html I am unable to verify if the code it writes is "correct". The only thing I'm able to do is load the webpage and see if it's what I want or copy/paste an error message. Furthermore I've tried using some CoPilot (with the extension in VS Code). I tried using it to convert a neural network written in TensorFlow to a neural network written in PyTorch. This would be usefull if it worked but I was unable to get the code to run successfully. I ran into multiple "loops" where I would get an error, CoPilot would change one line, I would get another error, and CoPilot would change the line right back to what it was originally. This demonstrated a lack of full understanding of the problem where likely the error message wasn't super helpful and CoPilot didn't/couldn't successfully debug it. Thus this ended up not being correct and therefore wasn't very useful.

I’ve mainly used ChatGPT to help me figure out how to implement certain features in the application my team is working on. Since I’m still getting the hang of TypeScript and React, it’s really helped speed up my learning by making it easier to understand the code my teammates have written. One example is when I needed to understand how to make an API call in TypeScript and how the different components were structured. It’s also been useful for testing my own knowledge where I’ll get a function outline and have to fill in the missing details, which helps me see if I actually get what’s going on. I’ve gotten more comfortable with TypeScript and Next.js. Using ChatGPT has also helped me properly connect the database for courses on the frontend of our app. It’s been a great tool for quickly picking up concepts and making sense of what my teammates have already built, plus it’s made debugging and refining things easier. To make sure the AI-generated code actually worked and made sense, I always checked that it fit in with the rest of our code and that I fully understood it instead of just copying it over without thinking.
