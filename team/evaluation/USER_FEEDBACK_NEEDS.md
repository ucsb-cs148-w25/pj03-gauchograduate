List in a new team/evaluation/USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md document (in priority order) three things about your product that you would love to have user feedback on. Just to give example possibilities: user preference between two designs, an A/B study on the consequences of two designs, user satisfaction with a particular feature, user satisfaction with your overall current product, but there are many more possibilities.

The more specific you can be on these items, the better. You get the points just for the ideation, but the idea is that this process facilitate and help you prepare one of the evaluations you list for the inter-team project evaluation exercise on 02/26/25, and the other team will actually try to answer your question while testing your deployment. Basically, you have 7 user study participants, the other teamâ€™s members, at your disposal for concrete feedback. Presumably, you will prepare your top priority user feedback solicitation, but maybe a different option if the top priority is not feasible to be evaluated by 2/26.
