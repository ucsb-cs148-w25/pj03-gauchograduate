# Retro Outcomes

We used start stop continue framework (limited starts as we are going into the last spring) mainly focusing on the continue and the stop.

Report:
* successes:
  - organized tasks on Kanban allowed work to move in a clear way ex. John and Kade put fake data while they were still pulling data
  - pull requests were clear and informative, generally reviewed pretty quickly. If there were errors they would still be addressed instead of being autoapproved.
  - the pair programming worked efficiently as we learned each others styles.
  - utilized everyone's skillset to work on each part of the app. solid balance of strengths and weaknesses. 
* a goal: identify something the team wants to get better at
  - getting more exposure to different parts of the app rather than being super specialized.
  - testing for bugs and features before pushing for a PR
  - try for all of us to show up to class
* a commitment: identify one thing that the team pledges to do to maximize productivity towards launch
  - We will be committed and work hard toward the final presentation.
