## Action item

Goals:
- Address things we all have to work on regarding planning
- Individually write tests for everything we implement
- More documentation/commenting
- Refactoring backend code for clarity and scalability
- Complete issues quicker

Changes:
- Meeting once a week outside of class on saturdays for short dicussion/catch up
- Communicating with Mentor more for lab requirements

Measurements:
- How many issues have we completed within the past week?
- How do we like these additions to the workflow compared to before?
- Are we more effective at staying on top of our deliverables?
- Is team cooperation better?

## Optional: MVP Refelction
- Good feedback overall, we had many features students liked.
- Our UI is easy to navigate and consistent, which is good.
- Add more useful features such as gpa calculator, automatic course history, and future course suggestions

## Retro Assessment

* We individually reflected on what we as a team want to start, stop, and continue doing for 10 minutes. Then we had a team discussion and decided on a few action items we want to focus on, and identify what was the change we wanted to see for next week.
* It was productive and the team correctly identified our shortcomings and things we were doing good at. As a collective, we had much more to say about how to move forward because we have experience working with each other. We are more comfortable with the workflow and style as it is.
* Open discussion is the best way to ensure a good retro experience.
  
## Experiment/Change
- experiment: Communicating with Mentor to clarify lab requirements and meet outside of class.
- Result: We scored well on Lab 6, and we hope that this change will keep us from missing random points on future labs.
- Decision: We want to keep this change so that we get credit for the work we put in.
