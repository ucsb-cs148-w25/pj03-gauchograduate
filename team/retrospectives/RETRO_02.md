## Retro Assessment

* We individually reflected on what we as a team want to start, stop, and continue doing for 10 minutes. Then we had a team discussion and decided on a few action items we want to focus on, and identify what was the change we wanted to see for next week.
* It was productive and the team correctly identified our shortcomings and things we were doing good at. 
* Encourage everyone to speak!
* As a collective, we had much more to say about how to move forward because we have experience working with each other. We are more comfortable with the workflow and style as it is.
