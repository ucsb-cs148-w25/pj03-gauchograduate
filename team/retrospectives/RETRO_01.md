#Sprint Retrospective
## Date of Retrospective: 01/24/25
### Team: John Kim[x],  Jaren Lowe[x],  Kade Williams[x], Selena Zeng[x] Taedon Reth[x], Vala Bahrami[x], Chiran Arumugam[x]
* Led by: Selena Zeng


Everyone present. No further roadblocks.

## Action item

Start:
- reviewing pull requests earlier
- communicating outside of lecture/lab via Slack/Messages
- getting started on your tasks earlier
- working with each other between subgroups

Experiment/Change:
- Stop waiting until the deadlines to submit PR's (have things done by Wednesday)
- Stop showing up late to class

Continue:
- working in pairs/mobs and together
- planning all of the tasks the week before

  ## Retro Assessment

* I had everyone individually reflect on what we as a team want to start, stop, and continue doing for about 10 minutes. Then we had a team discussion and decided on a few action items we want to focus on, and identify what was the change we wanted to see for next week.
* It was productive and the team correctly identified our shortcomings and things we were doing good at. 
* Encourage everyone to speak!

## Experiment/Change
- experiment: have items done by Wednesday (in class) for tasks due Friday
- Result: We have more features than we needed to for the MVP, we are all on the same page for Wednesday and have more things to discuss + help each other with.
- Decision: keep the change because it has been productive for us so far
