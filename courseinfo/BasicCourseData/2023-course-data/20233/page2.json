In th is course we take aim at several key constructs found in contemporary Psych ology ? e.g., mind, self, memory, consciousness ? and subject them to empir ical and logical analysis. The result is that many of our favorite terms ar e found to be in need of serious and sustained conceptual analysis.",

Theater forms like Chinese Jingju and Japanese Noh will prompt us to reevaluate what the performer does in rehear sal and in situations on and off the stage. By exploring recent modern and contemporary performance forms, we will reassess how an actor, dancer, or p uppeteer can challenge the status quo and effect change. As we ask these qu estions, we will situate Asian performance within social, political, and hi storical contexts to understand its rich functions and significances.",
