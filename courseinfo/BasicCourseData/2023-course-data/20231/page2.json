Starting with the Jewish Holocaust and working our way to Palestine, Lebanon, Israel and New York (9/11), we examine how the graphic novel takes up such ethical problems as the limits of representation, the relationship between fiction and testimony, as well as that between trauma, memory and mourning. We also deal with questions of moral responsibility a nd accountability with regard to acts of torture. While these will be our p redominant concerns, we also look into how graphic novels self-referentiall y comment upon the process of artistic composition.",
