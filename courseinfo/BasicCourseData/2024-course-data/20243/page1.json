Most people in industrialized settings rely o n the internet for all aspects of life, including education, employment, he althcare, politics and personal relationships. At the same time, these tool s are expensive, fragile, and often complicated to use. As a result, there are inequalities in who has access to digital technology and who can use it successfully. This class examines these inequalities and the ways they inf luence, and are influenced by, larger socio-economic inequalities. We explo re relevant theories, review current data, and consider creative interventi ons to help reduce digital divides in years to come.",

Short stories often show how moments that might appear very ordinary to most of us can in fact be momentous, utterly transformative, for somebod y.  In this, for modern, humdrum, everyday lives, they can provide a kind o f modernist sublime.
