This course helps us consider this pressing question by engaging past and present theories of cinema’s effect on landscapes of mass culture. Beginning with film photography at the cusp of modernity, before tracing positive and negative appraisals of cinema’s ideological power, we ultimately consider arguments for why public filmgoing should matter: insofar as collective viewership may challenge insufficient assumptions, open up newfound ethical possibilities, and incite astonishing alternatives to the status quo.",
