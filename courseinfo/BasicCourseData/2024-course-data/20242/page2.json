Ireland, like California, is a territory o n the western edge of a continent about which many mythologies have grown u p.  In Ireland's case, these mostly have to do with the supposed mystery of the place, its romance and mythic past, or its violence, or its long bitte r history. Who invented these versions of the place, and whose interests do they serve? Why do people continue to believe them? How have they changed? We consider how one small country has been imagined as \"other\" - as wild, strange, dangerous, fanatic - and how the Irish in their literature, speak back. In Irish literature, they reinvent Irishness.",
